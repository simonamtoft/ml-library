# Recurrence and Attention in Latent Variable Models
In this project, we study recurrent latent variable models for image generation. We focus on attentive models, i.e. models that use attention to decide where to focus on and what to update, refining their output with a sequential update. This is done by implementing the DRAW model, which is described in [the DRAW paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04623), both with basic and filterbank attention. The performance of the implemented DRAW model is then compared to both a standard VAE and a LadderVAE implementation.
